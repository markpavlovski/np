          <p class="ind">An outing on the Nashua River is a perfect event for companies, groups and clubs. Paddling down a river brings people together in a new way. The Nashua is a friendly river, a fun and easy paddle for novices. Most group paddles are self-guided.
            We set you off off with maps, an overview talk about the Nashua River, including picnicking spots and some paddling and safety tips. If you prefer a guided tour, our qualified guide/naturalists can enrich your outing by sharing their
            experiences and knowledge of the places you'll explore as well as provide expertise in paddling and safety. Another option is to arrange a <a href="river-classroom.html">River Classroom<span style="vertical-align:super; font-size: small;">&reg;</span></a>                    experience for your group, an educational program to teach your group about the river ecosystem.</p>

          <div class="sessionst">

              <ul>
