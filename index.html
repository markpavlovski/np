            Rent quality Old Town canoes and kayaks and BIC stand up paddleboards on the beautiful, friendly Nashua River in West Groton,
            Massachusetts. Launch from our rental site and paddle for hours in either direction! Our friendly rental staff will assist you
            with your boat, provide paddling and safety tips, give you an idea of what you might see on the river, and share the amazing
            story of the Nashua River's history. Have fun exploring the main channel of the Nashua, the smaller tributary of the
            Squannacook, and the pond-like ox bow of Dead River. Each season brings different experiences and sightings. We offer discounted
            weekday rental rates, season passes, and group discounts.

            An outing on the Nashua River is a perfect event for companies, groups and clubs. Paddling down a river brings people together
            in a new way. The Nashua is a friendly river, a fun and easy paddle for novices. Most group paddles are self-guided. We set you
            off off with maps, an overview talk about the Nashua River, including picnicking spots and some paddling and safety tips. If you
            prefer a guided tour, our qualified guide/naturalists can enrich your outing by sharing their experiences and knowledge of the
            places you'll explore as well as provide expertise in paddling and safety. Another option is to arrange a
            <a href="river-classroom.html">River Classroom<span style="vertical-align:super; font-size: small;">&reg;</span></a> experience
            for your group, an educational program to teach your group about the river ecosystem.
