            An outing on the Nashua River is a perfect event for companies, groups and clubs. Paddling down a river brings people together
            in a new way. The Nashua is a friendly river, a fun and easy paddle for novices. Most group paddles are self-guided. We set you
            off off with maps, an overview talk about the Nashua River, including picnicking spots and some paddling and safety tips. If you
            prefer a guided tour, our qualified guide/naturalists can enrich your outing by sharing their experiences and knowledge of the
            places you'll explore as well as provide expertise in paddling and safety. Another option is to arrange a
            <a href="river-classroom.html">River Classroom<span style="vertical-align:super; font-size: small;">&reg;</span></a> experience
            for your group, an educational program to teach your group about the river ecosystem.

            </li>
            <li>
