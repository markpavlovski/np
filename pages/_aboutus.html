     <p><b>THE OWNERS, a note from Diane.</b> My husband, two daughters, and I moved to Groton in 1993 and immediately fell in love with the beautiful rivers and conservation lands in the area. These places have become  such an integral part of our lives and we have grown to know them well over the years. In 2009, after managing Nashoba Paddler for 13 years,  I and my husband, Pete, purchased Nashoba Paddler with the hopes of continuing its mission to introduce people to the river and to responsible paddling.  We feel so fortunate to be part of this river community and invite you to join us in experiencing the beauty, the peace, and the fun that a day on the river provides.</p>
    
	<img src="../images/line_2.gif" alt="line_2" class="scalec" />  
    
    <p><b>OUR LOCATION on the NASHUA RIVER.</b> Our riverside rental base is located on a friendly, forested flatwater section of the Nashua River where it's common to see  turtles, blue herons, muscrats, beaver,   osprey, and an occasional mink, owl, deer, or even bald eagle! The fishing is excellent. You can paddle for hours in either direction enjoying the surrounding conservation land. </p>
 
 	<p>A trip to Nashoba Paddler is not only a recreational outing, but also an opportunity for adults and children to learn something about the river environment! Our changing educational display provides information about   river creatures and about issues affecting the river. Look though field guides to learn about what you just saw during your trip. Read the award-winning children's book, A River Ran Wild, about the amazing environmental history of  the Nashua River as it transitioned from a pristine waterway inhabited by Native Americans to  a severely polluted dead river and back to a beautiful fishable and swimmable
  river. </p>   
    
	<img src="../images/line_2.gif" alt="line_2" class="scalec" />  
    
    <p><b>OUR MISSION. </b>We are a small, family-owned, family-friendly business. Our goals are two-fold; first, to get people out on the river so that they can connect with nature and  the river environment and become educated stewards; and second, to promote paddlesports as an activity that can be enjoyed at any age. 
      Now in our 24th season, we are dedicated to furthering river education and protecting the
      environment. In 2009, owner, Diane Carson was recognized at the Nashua River Watershed Association's 40th Anniversary celebration for representing &quot;the kind of work that has gone on each day over the past 40 years to protect the natural resources of the Nashua River watershed.&quot; In 1997, Neal and Gail Menschel, of Nashoba Paddler, received the Nashua River Watershed Association's
      Greenway Award for &quot;helping people to fall in love with the river and become educated
      stewards.&quot;</p>

<p><b>OUR HISTORY. </b> Nashoba Paddler, LLC is owned by Diane &amp; Peter Carson. Nashoba Paddler was founded by Neal and Gail Menschel in 1992, offering rentals, tours, and instruction. Diane  began  managing the business in 1996 and shared their hope for the future of Nashoba Paddler. They had a vision of a business that would introduce people to the beauty of the Nashua River in hopes that they would fall in love with it and become active stewards. It grew beyond just a  rental business as the ideas of River Camp and River Classroom were brought to fruition. In 1998  River Classroom was given to the Nashua River Watershed Association to be part of their educational mission and the two organizations have continued to partner to provide watershed education canoeing field trips to hundreds of students and chaperones every year. River Camp continues to be a popular and successful summer experience for youth, ages 6-17, getting kids outside on the water, having fun adventures, and learning about nature.</p>
