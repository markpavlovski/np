    <h3>GO GREEN! Bike from Boston or Fitchburg (using the train)!</h3>
	<p class="ind">The <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=FITCHBRG" target="_blank">Fitchburg/ South Acton</a> train  allows bicycles except during peak hours.  From the train station in Ayer, cross Main Street and hop onto the Nashua River Rail Trail. Travel 2.75 miles to the third road intersection (Broadmeadow Rd). Turn left onto Broadmeadow Rd. and continue until it ends (.5mi), Turn right onto Farmer's Row (0.1mi) and left onto Long Hill Rd/ Rt 225 (0.8mi). Enjoy the ride downhill! After crossing the Nashua River, the road becomes West Main St/ Rt 225. Nashoba Paddler will be on your left.</p>
