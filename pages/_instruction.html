	<p class="ind">Kayaking, canoeing and stand-up paddleboarding are great ways to get outdoors, have fun, get some exercise, and enjoy nature. Though people are often able to just jump into a boat and make it &quot;go&quot;, it's  surprising what a difference it makes when you know how to  perform a few basic strokes correctly and efficiently. Knowing about safety can also give you a peace of mind when you venture out on the water. </p>
	
    <p class="ind">You may be an experienced paddler wishing to learn the latest in   efficient paddling techniques or expand your skills, or you may be a novice aspiring to master  control of a kayak or canoe. Either way, we'll  to help you to reach your goals and to enjoy your paddling experiences. Besides exercises in paddling,   you'll enjoy the lovely locations of our classes. And since our instructors are also naturalists, you may also learn a bit about the nature around you, no extra charge!</p>
  
 
  <p>* Students receive a 20% discount on additional rentals during the current season.</p>
