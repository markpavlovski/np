<h1 id="groups">Group Rental Options</h1>
<h5>Great for Company Outings, Clubs,  Youth Programs, Reunions, Parties, and Day Trips with Friends and Family!</h5>

<br />

<p class="ind">An outing on the Nashua River is a perfect event for companies, groups and clubs.
Paddling down a river brings people together in a new way. The Nashua is a friendly
river, a fun and easy paddle for novices. Most group paddles are self-guided. We set you
off off with maps, an overview talk about the Nashua River, including picnicking spots
and some paddling and safety tips. If you prefer a guided tour, our qualified guide/naturalists can enrich your outing by sharing their experiences and knowledge of the  places you'll explore as well as provide expertise in paddling and safety. Another option is to arrange a  <a href="_education.html">River Classroom<span style="vertical-align:super; font-size: small;">&reg;</span></a> experience for your group, an educational program to teach your group about the river  ecosystem.</p>


<h4>samples of our Group Trip Options</h4>

     <ul class="bullet2">
        <li>2-3 hour round-trip paddle heading upstream from Nashoba Paddler to Dead River to see turtles or continuing further to the Squannacook River to see a beaver dam. Return downstream with the current.  Our cheapest and most common option. (No shuttle involved)</li>
       <li>2-3 hour paddle downstream from Nashoba Paddler to Pepperell Pond, ending at a
        picnic site at the Petapawag canoe launch on Rt. 119. Take some additional time to explore the pond area, if you'd like. (1 shuttle)</li>
        <li>4-5 hour downstream paddle from Ayer to Pepperell with a beautiful, midway picnic stop among
        the pines. (2 shuttles)</li>
        <li>4-5 hour excursion on the Nashua's tributary, the Squannacook, up to Bertozzi
    Wildlife Management area for a picnic and back again, for small groups. (2 shuttles)</li>
     </ul>
 
 
 <p><strong>GROUP DISCOUNTS:</strong> 10% discount when renting 6 or more boats.</p>
