	<p class="ind">Kayaking and canoeing are great ways to get outdoors, have fun, get some exercise, and enjoy nature. Though people are often able to just jump into a boat and make it &quot;go&quot;, it's  surprising what a difference it makes when you know how to  perform a few basic strokes correctly and efficiently. Knowing about safety can also give you a peace of mind when you venture out on the water. </p>
	
    <p class="ind">You may be an experienced paddler wishing to learn the latest in   efficient paddling techniques or expand your skills, or you may be a novice aspiring to master  control of a kayak or canoe. Either way, we'll  to help you to reach your goals and to enjoy your paddling experiences. Besides exercises in paddling,   you'll enjoy the lovely locations of our classes. And since our instructors are also naturalists, you may also learn a bit about the nature around you, no extra charge!</p>

	<h1>Paddling Clinics</h1>
  
    <p class="ind">Our introductory clinics have been set up such that they can be taken in two parts, allowing flexibility and time to practice between lessons if desired. This also allows you to take advantage of our discounted rentals for clinic participants. Our experienced instructors are certified by the American Canoe Association. Clinics have a ratio of 6 participants to 1 instructor with a minimum of 4 participants. Prices include the use of  our boats, paddles, and personal flotation devices but you may certainly use your own equipment if you prefer. (If   fewer than 4 participants register, you will have the option to take a private or semi-private lesson for an   additional charge.) </p>
