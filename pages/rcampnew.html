<p><em>&quot;I liked when we went to &quot;Blueberry Island&quot;.  We flipped the boats over and tried to get on top of them.  It was really fun!  I also learned lots of different strokes and learned that there's more than one way to paddle a canoe.  &quot;</em></p>

  <p><em>I really liked the experience of going down the whitewater.  I liked how quickly the water spun you into the quiet water behind a rock when you eddied out.  I paddled with a councilor the first day so I wasn't scared.  On the second day I paddled with someone else and I felt like I could handle it.&quot; </em></p>

Three intense days of paddling on class 1 and 2 rapids on the Deerfield River in western Massachusetts, two nights camping on the riverside, combined with study about the river's history and current issues, will allow them to keep old paddling friends and make new ones as they deepen their appreciation of this beautiful river.</p></td>

<h1>Highlights from Last Year's Camps!</h1>

<p><strong>WEE PADDLERS</strong> learned some nature trivia as well as paddling skills.  What is the largest rodent in North America?  <a href="http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Castor_canadensis/" target="_blank">ANSWER</a>  (Ages 6 & 7)</p>

<p><strong>CANOE, CRAFTS, & LORE</strong> campers enjoyed a bumper crop of blueberries on "Blueberry Island".  They were able to grab handfuls of plump berries from the laden bushes as they paddled past! (Ages 8-10)</p>

<p><strong>EXPLORATIONS</strong> campers took a canal tour in Lowell and learned about the changes that the river experienced during the last 200 years.  It was quite different from the naturally meandering waterways they had been paddling!   (Ages 11-14)</p>

<p><strong>ADVENTURE CHALLENGE</strong> paddlers canoed the Deerfield River for the first time since Hurricaine Irene.  The power of the flood had moved giant boulders and rearranged shorelines, making it a completely different river. (Ages 13-16)</p>

<p><strong>LEADERSHIP EXPEDITION</strong> teens demonstrated their leadership as they confronted an unexpected lowering of the St. Croix River for dam repairs. They utilized all they had been taught and successfully maneuvered their boats around all the exposed rocks with almost no portaging.  It was so challenging and fun and the Camp Leaders were so impressed with their skills!
(This session is offered every other year, so look for it again in 2014.)</p>

<h3>WHAT is River Camp?</h3>
<p>River Camp is a unique adventure-based environmental education canoeing camp. It features small, close-knit groups led by qualified adult leaders. Campers explore various outstanding regional waterways, discovering a rich heritage of cultural, environmental and geological history, along with an abundance of wildlife and clean water. River Camp, a licensed recreational camp for children, has been educating young river-lovers/paddling enthusiasts since 1997. </p>

<h3>WHY River Camp?</h3>
<p>The world of river paddling is exciting. Learning how to control a canoe with precision builds self esteem. At River Camp, paddling skills are reinforced with fun on-water games, challenges, and exciting river trips. Canoeing is a lifelong, dynamic sport, constantly embracing new ideas on technique, safety, and equipment. Our staff is certified to teach the latest in paddling technique by the American Canoe Association, giving special emphasis to river safety. Each week the environment comes alive through expedition science. Campers enjoy hands-on field study explorations along the river with plenty of time for play, relaxation, games and picnicking. </p>

<h3>WHO runs River Camp?</h3>
<p>River Camp is operated by Nashoba Paddler, LLC. Dedicated to serving the community, protecting the environment, and furthering river education, Nashoba Paddler partners with the Nashua River Watershed Association on its River Classroom program as well as offering nature tours, canoe &amp; kayak rentals and instruction.

All leaders are CPR and First Aid certified and are either lifeguards or certified canoeing instructors. <a href="aboutus.html#leaders">Learn more about our camp leaders</a>. </p>
