<h1>2012 Nature Paddling Tours</h1>

<p>Our tours are kept small so we maximize our enjoyment and minimize our impact on the environment. Prices include the use of our boats, paddles, and personal flotation devices. (You may use your own equipment if you prefer.) Our guides are naturalists as well as American Canoe Association certified instructors who are there to share their knowledge of the river and help you with your paddling, if you need it. Tours are geared for beginner/intermediate paddlers and are very relaxed with the objective of observing and enjoying the nature around us.</p>
