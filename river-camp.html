    <h1>Highlights from Last Year's Camps!</h1>


	<p><b>WEE PADDLERS</b> learned some nature trivia as well as paddling skills.  What is the largest rodent in North America?  <a href="http://www.biokids.umich.edu/critters/Castor_canadensis/" target="_blank">ANSWER</a>  (Ages 6 & 7)</p>

	<p><b>CANOE, CRAFTS, & LORE</b> campers enjoyed a bumper crop of blueberries on "Blueberry Island".  They were able to grab handfuls of plump berries from the laden bushes as they paddled past! (Ages 8-10)</p>

	<p><b>EXPLORATIONS</b> campers took a canal tour in Lowell and learned about the changes that the river experienced during the last 200 years.  It was quite different from the naturally meandering waterways they had been paddling!   (Ages 11-14)</p>

	<p><b>ADVENTURE CHALLENGE</b> paddlers canoed the Deerfield River for the first time since Hurricaine Irene.  The power of the flood had moved giant boulders and rearranged shorelines, making it a completely different river. (Ages 13-16)</p>

	<p><b>LEADERSHIP EXPEDITION</b> teens demonstrated their leadership as they confronted an unexpected lowering of the St. Croix River for dam repairs. They utilized all they had been taught and successfully maneuvered their boats around all the exposed rocks with almost no portaging.  It was so challenging and fun and the Camp Leaders were so impressed with their skills!
(This session is offered every other year, so look for it again in 2014.)</p>

          <h2>WHAT IS RIVER CAMP?</h2>
          <p class="ind">
            River Camp is a unique, adventure-based, environmental education canoeing camp. Campers have fun spending the days outdoors,
            experiencing and exploring nature. They learn valuable canoeing skills while paddling different local rivers and water bodies.
            Sessions are enhanced by visits from experts, educational tours, field studies, service projects, stories and crafts (for
            younger campers), and overnight canoe camping expeditions (for older campers). Sessions are kept small with low ratios, to
            ensure individual attention and provide the opportunity for campers to get to know each other.
          </p>

          <h2>WHY RIVER CAMP?</h2>
          <p class="ind">
            Campers leave with a greater connection, appreciation and respect for the outdoors. They build self-esteem and learn team-work
            through mastering control of a canoe. Our expeditions provide campers with opportunities for leadership roles. Campers meet new
            friends and develop camaraderie through the adventures they share together.
          </p>

          <h2>WHO RUNS RIVER CAMP?</h2>
          <p class="ind">
            River Camp is operated by Nashoba Paddler LLC. Its <a href="about-us.html#leaders">camp leaders</a> are teachers, outdoor
            educators, and river enthusiasts committed to providing a fun, safe nature learning experience. Campers are taught canoeing
            skills and safety by our American Canoe Association certified instructors. Every session has a lifeguard and all leaders hold
            CPR and First Aid certifications.

            I like River Camp because a lot of my friends do it and we get to learn about nature each day.  One of my favorite places that we go to is Dead River because we have seen Big Al there. He’s a giant snapping turtle and he is so cool.

            My favorite part of camp was the overnight because I never usually go camping and we got to sleep in tents and cook over a
            campfire. Also, I learned a lot at camp and I actually did a presentation on canoeing at school. It also made me decide to join
            the swim team because of the confidence I got around water.

            I liked going to “Blueberry Island” because it had a lot of interesting rocks and places to explore, and we could pick some
            blueberries. Two years ago we had to fight the wind to get to the island, but last year the conditions were good.

            It was the first time I paddled on white water. It was a lot of fun and interesting to learn about all the different strokes. I
            also liked going moose hunting. We saw about 20 moose including some families!

            I was scared at first, but I loved learning how to canoe on white water. It’s something I never would have done if it wasn’t for
            River Camp. And it was cool to see new places and hang out with people I didn’t know.

            One day we made ice cream! Our leader brought ice and salt with him in his boat. We each got to make our own. My first one
            leaked so I had to do it again, but it was worth it in the end - it was so good!
